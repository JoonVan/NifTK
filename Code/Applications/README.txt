Introduction
------------
This folder contains C++ executables, each one containing a "main" entry point.
They are currently all command line programs as the main NiftyView GUI lives
in Code/Gui/MITK.

Command Line Programs
---------------------

The main concerns are:

1. Initialise the logging.
2. Parse the command line.
3. Create your pipeline.
4. Execute it.
5. Tidy up if necessary.
