Freesurfer scripts
------------------
The scripts in this directory, are to facilitate anyone running Freesurfer.
When running the main Freesurfer workflow, the scripts can be run locally, or, if the command qsub exists
(like at CMIC), it will submit jobs to the CMIC cluster, and if mosenv exists (like at DRC), it will 
submit jobs to the DRC cluster.
