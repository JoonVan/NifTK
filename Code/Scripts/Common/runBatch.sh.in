function Usage() 
{
cat <<EOF

This script simply runs a file of commands against a cluster.
If it can't find the cluster, it runs it directly.

Usage: $0 filename

Mandatory Arguments:
 
  filename  : a text file containing a batch of commands, one per line.
  
              Remember, it't not ANY sequence of commands.
              Each line must be a separate standalone command.
              You can't guarantee the order, or that they will execute on the same machine.

exit 127
