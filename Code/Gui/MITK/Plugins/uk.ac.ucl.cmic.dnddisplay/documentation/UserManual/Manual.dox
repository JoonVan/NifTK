\section DragAndDropIntro Introduction

NiftyView provides the "Drag and Drop Display" Editor in addition to the standard
MITK based "Display". Both of these Editors can display images, surfaces, point-sets and so on. However

\li Display: by default shows all data sets that are marked as visible in the Data Manager, and manages a global "Geometry"
that is normally aligned with the global (also called "world") X,Y,Z coordinate axes. This display is perhaps more suitable
for image-guided surgery applications, or general viewing.
\li Drag and Drop Display: each viewer shows only the data sets that have been dropped into that viewer, and the "Geometry" is 
defined by the bounding box of the first image, and is aligned with that image. This Editor was developed as a replacement
for the MIDAS application at University College London's Dementia Research Centre.
 
\section DragAndDropUsage Usage

\subsection DragAndDropUsageLaunching Launching the Drag and Drop Display

The Drag and Drop Display should by default be available on application startup. If for any reason it has been closed,
then it can be relaunched by right-clicking on a data-set (i.e. an image) in the Data Manager. See Figure 1.

\image html DragDropLaunching.png "Figure 1. Launch the Drag and Drop Display by right clicking on a data-set in the DataManager and selecting Drag and Drop Display."

There are several user preferences that control the operation of the Drag and Drop Display and are particularly relevant at
startup. See Figure 2.

\image html DragDropPreferences.png "Figure 2. The preference page includes several options to control the dropping operation"

The preferences are:

<ul>
  <li>image interpolation: the user may select none (nearest neighbour), linear or cubic, and it takes effect the next time an image is dropped.
      Changing the default interpolation and then dropping the image into a viewer will set a persistant property on the image, 
      so that the image is rendered consistently in all views. </li> 
  <li>initial number of rows: the default number of rows of viewers when the Drag and Drop Display is first launched.</li>
  <li>initial number of columns: the default number of columns of viewers when the Drag and Drop Display is first launched.</li>
  <li>default view: when an image is dropped, you can select the default orientation (axial, coronal, sagittal, "as acquired").</li> 
      The "as acquired" option selects whatever view is in the X-Y plane of the image data.</li>
  <li> default drop type: when the user selects more than a single image, and drops them into a viewer, there are several choices about
       how these images are distributed across the available viewing panes.
    <ul>
      <li>single: all selected images are dropped into a single viewer</li>
      <li>multiple: all selected images are dropped into multiple viewers. So, if 3 images are selected they are dropped into 3 successive viewers</li>
      <li>all: all selected images are dropped into all available viewers. The maximum number is 5x5, so the screen switches to a 5x5 display, showing a thumbnail view of evenly spaced slices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</li> 

The Drag and Drop Display can have up to 5 rows of 5 columns of Viewers. However, each Viewer can contain either an axial,
sagittal, coronal layout, or indeed an orthogonal layout containing a linked axial, sagittal, and coronal layout. This provides
a lot of flexibility on layouts. For example, if the user clicks the 2x2 button, to get two rows of two columns of viewers
they can be configured as in Figure 3 with a sagittal view, an ortho-viewer, an axial view and a coronal view, with different 
images available in each view, and optionally linked cursors.

\image html DragDrop2x2.png "Figure 3. The Drag and Drop Display allows up to 5 rows of 5 columns of viewers, where each viewer can contain different images, and different layouts, including an ortho-viewer which itself contains an axial, sagittal, coronal and 3D view."

\subsection DragAndDropUsageDropping Viewing Images in the Drag and Drop Display

The user can select one or more data-sets and drop them into the main Drag and Drop Display viewing area. If a data-set has
derived child nodes, these will also be selected. See Figure 3.

\image html DragDropDroppingParentAndChildImage.png "Figure 3. If a parent is selected for drag and drop, the child image (called tmp) is also implicitly selected and dropped."

If 2 images are selected, and the default drop type is "single", then both images are dropped into the same viewer. This means
that one image will be rendered on top of the other. The images are rendererd in bottom-to-top order, as displayed in the DataManager
View. i.e. the top most image in the DataManager is painted on top of the other images. See Figure 4. To see both images in the same
viewer, the user must toggle visibility (checkbox to the left of the image name in the DataManager View). 

\image html DragDropSingle.png "Figure 4. 2 images dropped into the first viewer. The PET image is on top of the MR image."

If 2 images are selected, and the default drop type is "multiple" then images will be dropped across two windows. See Figure 5.

\image html DragDropMultiple.png "Figure 5. 2 images dropped into multiple (2) viewers. The PET image is first because it was selected first. The MR image is second."

If 2 images are selected, and the default drop type is "all" then both images are dropped into all 25 (5 rows of 5 columns) window
and the Drag and Drop Display arranges itself to display 25 thumbnail images. See Figure 6. In this example, the opacity of
the PET image is set to be semi-transparent, allowing simultaneous visualisation of the PET and MR data.

\image html DragDropAll.png "Figure 6. 2 images dropped into all viewers. Both images can be seen by toggling visibility or opacity in DataManager, and NiftyView displays evenly spaced thumbnail images."

\subsection DragAndDropControls The Main Controls of the Drag and Drop Display

By default the Drag and Drop Display controls remain hidden when they are not being used to allow the most amount of screen
space to be visible. The controls become visible when the user places the mouse cursor over a 15 pixel wide bar, at the top of
the Drag and Drop Display. 

\image html DragDropControls.png "Figure 7. The main controls appear when the mouse hovers at the top of the display."

The "currently selected viewer" can be selected by left mouse clicking on the image. The currently selected viewer is
indicated by a coloured border.

The main controls are 
\li Slice selection - applies to the currently selected viewer.
\li Magnification - applies to the currently selected viewer.
\li Time step - applies to the currently selected viewer allowing 4D images to be viewed.
\li Layout - buttons for 1x1, 1x2, 1x3, 2x2 and spin boxes for rows (1-5), and columns (1-5) to enable the user to select
the desired number of views. Remember that a "view" can itself be an ortho-viewer.
\li Orientation - select axial, sagittal, coronal, 3D, ortho-view, 3H (axial, sagittal and coronal displayed horizontally),
and 3V (axial, sagittal, coronal displayed vertically). 
\li Drop type - the user can switch between single, multiple, all as described above. In addition there is a checkbox
so the user can decide whether to drop images cumulatively into a viewer.
\li Bind type - The Drag and Drop Display can also link or "Bind" viewers together, where there is the option to bind
just the cursors, the magnification, or the geometry.

\subsection DragAndDropInteractions Interactions

Many features of the display can be controlled by key or mouse interactions.

\li Selecting position: single click with left mouse button
\li Zooming: dragging with the right mouse button (keeping it pressed and moving the mouse)
\li Panning: dragging with middle mouse button or dragging with the left button with Shift
\li Select previous slice: 'A' or scrolling up with the mouse wheel
\li Select next slice: 'Z' or scrolling down with the mouse wheel
\li Select next time step: Alt-A or scrolling up with the mouse wheel with Alt
\li Select previous time step: Alt-Z or scrolling down with the mouse wheel with Alt
\li Auto-scroll through slices backwards: Shift-A or start scrolling up with Shift
\li Auto-scroll through slices in forwards: Shift-Z or start scrolling down with Shift
\li Auto-scroll through time steps forwards: Shift-Alt-A or scrolling up with the mouse wheel with Shift-Alt
\li Auto-scroll through time steps backwards: Shift-Alt-Z or scrolling down with the mouse wheel with Shift-Alt
\li Switch to axial window: 'Q'
\li Switch to sagittal window: 'W'
\li Switch to coronal window: 'E'
\li Switch to 3D window: 'R'
\li Toggle between single and multiple window layout: 'T' or double click in a window
\li Toggle cursor visibility: 'X'

The slices are ordered in world coordinate system that is independent of the voxel coordinates.
The order of slices is the following:

\li axial orientation: from inferior to superior
\li sagittal orientation: from right to left
\li coronal orientation: from anterior to posterior

\subsection DragAndDropPreferences User Preferences for the Drag and Drop Display

The user preferences control important defaults that affect the operation of the Drag and Drop Display when it 
is launched and these have been described above. Refering to Figure 2 we additionally have

\li show drop type checkboxes - controls whether they are visible on the main control panel.
\li show layout buttons - controls whether they are visible on the main control panel.
\li show magnification slider - controls whether this is visible on the main control panel, as the user can alternatively 
right click and move to change the magnification.
\li show 3D view in orthoview - simply turns it on/off.
\li show 2D cursors - simply turn them on/off.
\li background colour - change the background of the 2D displays.

It can be seen that these are largely related to showing or hiding controls to try and reduce screen clutter.
