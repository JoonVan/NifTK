\section MorphEditorIntro Introduction

This plugin provides the MIDAS Morphological Editor Brain Segmentation algorithm 
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260797018038">[1]</a>, 
developed at the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London (UCL)</a>,
<a href="http://dementia.ion.ucl.ac.uk">Dementia Research Centre</a>.
The algorithm has been used in many publications since 1996, and several phase 1 and phase 2 
clinical drugs trials. The algorithm will now be described in detail, by stepping through each step, 
as it should be performed. The theory can be found in 
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260797018038">[1]</a>.

\li You will need a 3 button mouse, or 3 button mouse emulation.
\li The MIDAS Irregular Volume Editor is designed to work with the MIDAS Drag and Drop Display.

\section MorphEditorControls The Morphological Editor Controls

Initially an image must be loaded, normally a T1 weighted image of the head, and the image intensity
settings adjusted using the CMIC Image Lookup Tables plugin to get good contrast between white and grey matter. 
Note that while editing the brain segmentation, the intensity settings are for display purposes only. The settings
that are established as part of the segmentation are independent of how the image is displayed. Furthermore, the
editing works in 3D. So the thresholding, erosions, dilations and editing all impact the segmentation in 3D, not
just the currently viewed slice. At each stage of the segmentation, the main settings are remembered to enable the user 
to step backwards and repeat a given stage. In addition, the connection breaker has an undo facility so that voxels
that are added/subtract by the mouse buttons can be reversed. 

The aim of the segmentation is to label all voxels which are predominantly brain while excluding non-brain, for 
example, CSF, dura and the superior sagittal sinus. To launch the plugin, go to "Window", then "Show View", then 
"CMIC MIDAS Morphological Editor". The plugin dialog box (controls) are displayed (Figure 1). 

\image html MorphInitialScreen.png "Figure 1. The main control panel for the Morphological Editor."

At the bottom of the controls are 3 buttons:

<ul>
<li> Cancel - Abandon this segmentation altogether.</li>
<li> OK - finish the segmentation. This is only enabled at the end of the process.</li>
<li> Go to start - Go back to the beginning. This is only enabled after the first tab. </li>
</ul>

To start the segmentation, select a grey-scale image in the Data Manager.
At this point, the New Segmentation button will be enabled. Click this New Segmentation button, and you can
chose a name for the segmented volume, and also it's outline colour.

In most cases, whole brain segmentation can be accomplished in four steps:

<ul>
<li>Intensity Thresholding to exclude voxels outside the intensity range for brain.</li>
<li>Erosion to break connections between brain and non-brain.</li>
<li>Dilation to restore eroded brain.</li>
<li>Rethresholding to include missing voxels within brain.</li>
</ul>

These four steps are reflected in the design of the main plugin control panel, which has four tabs that are
completed one at a time, in order. 

\section MorphEditorThreshold Step 1. Intensity Thresholding

Intensity thresholds are set to exclude voxels brighter than brain (e.g. scalp) and darker than brain (e.g. CSF).
The upper threshold should be set first. Anything brighter than the upper threshold will be excluded. 
Leaving the lower threshold on zero, increase the upper threshold until there is no green signal intensity 
within brain (Figure 2).
 
\image html MorphThresholding.png "Figure 2. Lower threshold = 0, upper threshold set to exclude most of scalp."

Secondly, set the lower threshold initially to lower than half the value of the upper threshold and 
then adjust to include as much of brain as possible while minimising the inclusion of non-brain. 
The green intensity region should now include most of the brain (Figure 3).
 
\image html MorphLowerThreshold.png "Figure 3. Upper and lower thresholds set to include brain and exclude scalp and CSF."

Check the area around the cerebellum and temporal lobe. Check that most of the bridges - signal intensity connections 
linking brain to dura or superior sagittal sinus - are broken. Ideally the lower threshold should be taken to a high 
enough value so that in the next step only one erosion is needed to remove non-brain, however often connection breaker 
(see later) is required to break these bridges.

The final part of this step is to set the axial cut off slice (Figure 4). The aim is to remove any structures below the
inferior edge of the cerebellum. Move the slider until the cut off reaches the bottom of the cerebellum. 
Check other slices to ensure that all cerebellum is included. 

\image html MorphAxial.png "Figure 4. The axial cut-off (orange dotted line) should coincide with the bottom of the cerebellum."

Click Accept to proceed.

After you press Accept the plugin searches for the largest connected three-dimensional object in the current segmented region 
(i.e. brain) and removes any smaller unconnected objects. At this point it is worth having a rough look at how the 
brain region based on your thresholds would look after the next 2 steps.

\section MorphEditorErosion Step 2. Erosion - Break remaining connections between brain and non-brain. 

The erosion removes a layer of edge-voxels from all surfaces of the region. The purpose is to break thin connections 
between brain and scalp. The minimum erosions necessary to isolate brain from non-brain should be used. 
The usual range of erosions is [0, 3]. High numbers of erosions remove significant quantities of brain from the region 
that cannot be recovered in the Dilation stage. In this case, the thresholds may be at fault or the image may be artefactual 
or noisy. Eroded voxels have a signal intensity below the upper threshold value set in step 1. Increase the number of 
erosions one at a time. If one erosion is sufficient to remove all non-brain structures (Figure 5) click Accept and 
proceed to the next stage.

\image html MorphErosions.png "Figure 5. An eroded brain region disconnected from surrounding tissue."

Under the following circumstances, more than one erosion may be necessary:

If the edges of the brain region are still within grey matter, increase the erosions by one.

If the edges of the brain region are within white matter, another erosion may remove too much. 

There are two ways to proceed.

Often the brain remains connected to scalp on only a few slices, often around the temporal lobes. If connections 
can be identified visually, then they can be broken interactively at this stage by striking through them with the 
mouse while holding down the middle button. Areas where connections have been interactively broken appear orange. 
When all connections between brain and non-brain have been removed, all parts of the region external to brain are 
removed automatically due to the connected component filtering.

To use connection breaker click the middle button of the mouse whilst in erosion and / or dilation sections. 
The width of the interactive connection breaker can be set by adjusting the cursor width slider bar from 1-6. 
The right mouse button will remove the connection breaker and the left will add in additional region.

Further erosions can be done, but the upper threshold can be lowered so that the white matter of brain is not 
eroded. This can break lower intensity connections between brain and scalp or dura without eroding any more brain
When the brain has been disconnected from other tissues (Figure 5) click Accept and proceed to the next stage.
To restart the erosion process, click Reset. Otherwise, click Accept and move to step 3.

\section MorphEditorDilation Step 3. Dilation - Restore Eroded Brain

The purpose of this step is to recover the brain voxels that have been removed by erosion. Each dilation grows 
out from the edges of the current brain region but only into voxels within the currently defined range of intensities 
which represent brain (Figure 6). The intensity thresholds that appear at this point are automatically set by calculating 
the mean signal intensity over the whole brain region after step 2 and taking 60% and 160% of this value. These percentages 
have been determined to be suitable for T1-weighted volumes. These thresholds are re-calculated after each dilation as 
more voxels are recovered.

The number of dilations that are needed to recover all brain voxels depends on the number of erosions 
(typically = number of erosions + 1 or 2). Keep the number low enough so that no dura or sagittal sinus are 
included even if this results in a small proportion of brain not being included. Always check around the eyes 
to ensure that the region has not extended into this area. Finally, check the image on both the sagittal and axial views.

The connection breaker can also be used at this stage to remove any final areas of scalp / dura which are attached.

Click Accept and proceed to step 4.

\image html MorphDilations.png "Figure 6. Dilations recover previously eroded brain voxels."

\section MorphEditorRethresholding Step 4. Rethresholding - Reclaim remaining excluded areas

This step is generally not required. However if you have small areas missing from the brain region this may 
remove the need for manual editing (see step 5). Be aware that it will also remove any tissue outside the thresholds 
within the brain, so if you use this tool ensure you check the brain region. This step completes the segmentation. 
The rethresholding box is a box of X3 voxels that moves across the outlined brain region and fills in any area within 
that region that has been omitted by step 3 subject to the following constraints:

\li the omitted area must be smaller than the box.
\li only those voxels that have a signal intensity of between 60% and 160% of the mean brain intensity will be included.
\li the missing area must already be internal to the region.

Generally, a rethresholding box size of 6 will be large enough to recover any areas that have previously been excluded. 
Check sagittal and axial views one final time. Click OK to exit Morph Volume and leave the new region on the image. 
You can save the regions at this stage, but ensure it is deleted once the final edited region has been saved.
Always check slices at the front and back of the brain on coronal, sagittal and axial views to check for wrap and 
other segmentation defects. Most scans will be relatively simple to segment due to large areas of CSF separating 
brain from dura and the sagittal sinus. However, there are some scans where there is very little CSF between brain 
and dura making it very difficult when eroding and dilating. In these cases, it is better to accept that the segmentation 
process alone will not produce a good brain region and that some manual editing will need to be done.

\section MorphEditorManual Step 5. Manual editing

In cases where either some non-brain tissue remains in the segmentation, or brain tissue has been omitted, 
manual editing is usually required. It is important to remember that, unlike the automated whole brain segmentation, 
editing is limited to the slice being viewed i.e. segmentation does not work on the 3D volume.

Manual segmentation is done using the Irregular Volume Editor plugin. This can be launched by selecting "Window"
then "Show View" then "CMIC MIDAS Irregular Volume Editor". The plugin can be initialized by clicking on the
segmented volume.

Select the slices where the segmentation needs editing, pay particular attention to the temporal 
lobes and cerebellum, as these are areas where editing is most often required. If brain tissue has been excluded, 
the border can be deleted by clicking on the Draw button in the irregular volume window and holding down the middle 
mouse button. [Matt - dont understand this 'A new border can be redrawn using the left mouse button. The position 
bar can be used to show the equivelent slice in the other view, this is also shown by the region being red on the 
voxels where the views align.'] New regions can be included by placing a seed in the appropriate area. Select the 
Seed button in the irregular volume window and press the right mouse button. Seeds can be deleted using the middle 
mouse button. Either a border can be drawn manually around the structure, or alternatively upper and lower thresholds 
can be selected to automatically delineate the structure.To automatically deliniate/rethreshold a structure set the 
upper threshold to 100%. Then adjust the lower threshold until a blue outline can be seen. Keep lowering the threshold 
until this blue outline just disappears. This ensures the new threshold matches the current thresholding. This can be 
helpful when a stucture has been removed in error. Finally, the new region should be viewed in all planes to ensure 
that the manual editing process has not introduced new errors into the segmentation. 

\section MorphEditorSave Step 6. Save the segmented region

Don't forget to save the segmented image. At this stage, there is no database associated with this plugin.
This will be completed in the next phase of the project.
