\section Introduction

The purpose of the plugin is to provide a simple interface for creating an iso-surface from 3D and 4D volumes. 
Floating point and label images are supported as well. The surface is extracted using the marching cubes 
algorithm with an optional smoothing and decimation step.

\section Usage

The "Reference Image" label on the top of the view shows if an image of a supported type is selected. 
If there is none then the controls of the plugin are disabled.

Select a 3D volume from the Data Manager then press the "Create" button to create a new surface node.

A new subnode called "Surface 1" will appear in the Data Manager under the reference image node. In the 
Surface Extractor view the name of the surface will appear under the name of the reference image, and 
the controls of the view will be enabled. You can adjust the parameters, and calculate the surface with 
the "Apply" button or simply by pressing Enter. If you have modified the parameters, but you want to 
discard these changes, press Escape, and the original parameters will be restored from the surface node.

The meaning of the parameters is summarized below. If you move the mouse over a field, you will get 
a hint of the meaning of the field. The default value of the parameters of the new nodes can be customized 
in the preferences page of the plugin.

<ul>
  <li>threshold: Threshold that is used to create the surface. All pixels in the input image that are higher 
        than that value will be considered in the surface.</li>
  <li>smoothing: Perform Gaussian smoothing.</li>
  <li>gaussian std.dev: Standard deviation for the gaussian smoothing.</li>
  <li>target reduction: the desired target reduction of triangles in the range from 0.0 to 1.0.
       The destroyed triangles are in relation with the size of data. For example 0.9
       will reduce the data set to 10% of its original size.</li>
  <li>max. number of polygons: High number of polygons can make the rendering slow. If the number of the 
      polygon is higher then this number then you will be asked after the calculation if you want to 
      keep the surface or discard it.</li>
</ul>

You can create several surfaces for the same image with different set of parameters. The parameters used to 
create the surface will be stored in the node, and will be retrieved from them when you next select the surface. 
Each surface will have a different colour. The visualization of the surfaces can be switched 
on and off individually in the Data Manager view by using the check boxes next to the name of the node. The next 
screenshot shows two surfaces. For the yellow surface a higher threshold has been used.

Finally, here is a screenshot of the surface of a labelled volume.

\section Preferences

You can set up the default value of the surface extraction parameters in the preferences page of the plugin. 
To access the page select the Window / Preferences menu, and choose Surface Extractor from the left side list.
