\section Usage

The plugin provides a simple view for browsing XNAT databases and importing images into NiftyView (Figure 1).

You can connect to an XNAT server by pressing the 'Login' button. This opens the Login Profiles dialog window (Figure 2) where
you can specify the parameters of the connection. You can save this information to a profile by filling the 'Profile name'
field and clicking on 'Save'. For security reasons only the server URI and the user name is saved with the profile, 
the password is not. 

You can mark a profile as default, so that its parameters will be loaded if you open
the dialog window next time.

If you are connected to the server, you can browse its data by expanding the items of the tree (Figure 3). At the outermost level
you will see the projects, below that the subjects then the sessions. The sessions can contain scans and reconstructions
can contain the actual image files categorised by their type (typically DICOM or NIFTI).

You can import an image file by selecting its tree item and pushing the 'Import' button. If the selected file is a DICOM
file then only that file will be imported, not the whole DICOM series. If you want to import the whole volume instead of
a single slice then select the 'DICOM' item and click on 'Import All'. 

The imported image will be added to the Data Manager.

A few more functions are available if you click on 'More XNAT functions' (Figure 4). The 'Refresh' button updates the 
tree contents. If you want to download images from XNAT to your file system without adding them to the Data Manager, 
you can press the 'Download' or 'Download All' button, respectively. After clicking on them a dialog will pop up for 
choosing the download directory.

You can set the default download directory on the preferences page of the plugin (Figure 5). The plugin also uses a
work directory for storing temporary files on the file system.
