\section ImageStatisticsIntroduction Introduction

The Image Statistics View provides a simple way to calculate image statistics such as minimum, maximum, mean and standard
deviation of an image, or of an image within regions of interest specified by a label image.

\section ImageStatisticsUsage Usage

\image html ImageStatisticsViewPlugin.png Figure 1. Once valid images are selected, statistics can be seen for multiple labels.

The basic operation is as follows:

\li The user can select a single grey scale image or a grey scale image followed by a labelled image using the 
<a href="qthelp://org.mitk.gui.qt.datamanager/bundle/index.html">Data Manager</a>.
\li If the user preference "auto-update" is set to true, the statistics are calculated as soon as the selection is valid.
\li If the user preference "auto-update" is false, the user should hit the "update" button on the Image Statistics View.
\li A "valid" selection means either 1 or 2 images of the same size.

<b>Note: The order of selection is important. The first selection must be the grey scale image.</b>

The output shows:

\li If the user selected a single grey scale image, a single row of statistics are shown for the whole image, disregarding the background value.
\li If the user selected a grey scale image, and a binary image, statistics are shown for the foreground and background.
\li If the user selected a grey scale image and a label image, there is also a user preference "assume a binary mask". If true, 
any label value that is not the background value will be considered foreground, and this case is equivalent to case 2. If 
false, the statistics are computed for each label value.
 
\section ImageStatisticsPreferences Preferences

The available preferences are:

\li If "auto-update" is true, the statistics are calculated as soon as a selection is 
valid. If false, the user must hit the "update" button.
\li If "assume a binary mask" is true, then any mask value that does not match the background
value is considered a foreground value, effectively enabling a label image to be used as
a binary mask.
\li "background value" is used to specify the background value for grey scale images, that
will be ignored in the image, when just a grey scale image is selected. When a mask is
used, the background value is used to specify which mask value is deemed to be background.
