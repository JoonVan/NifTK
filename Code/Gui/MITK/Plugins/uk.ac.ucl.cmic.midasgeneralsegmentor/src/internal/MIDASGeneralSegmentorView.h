/**
 * \class MIDASGeneralSegmentorView
 * \brief Provides the MIDAS general purpose, Irregular Volume Editor functionality originally developed
 * at the Dementia Research Centre UCL (http://dementia.ion.ucl.ac.uk/).
 *
 * \ingroup uk_ac_ucl_cmic_midasgeneralsegmentor_internal
 *
 * This class uses the mitk::ToolManager and associated framework described in this paper on the
 * <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260709001229">MITK Segmentation framework</a>.
 *
 * The mitk::ToolManager has the following data sets registered in this order.
 * <pre>
 *   0. mitk::Image = the image being segmented, i.e. The Output.
 *   1. mitk::PointSet = the seeds for region growing, noting that the seeds are in 3D, spreading throughout the volume.
 *   2. mitk::ContourModelSet = a set of contours for the current slice being edited - representing the current segmentation, i.e. green lines in MIDAS, but drawn here in orange.
 *   3. mitk::ContourModelSet = a set of contours specifically for the draw tool, i.e. also green lines in MIDAS, and also drawn here in orange.
 *   4. mitk::ContourModelSet = a set of contours for the prior slice, i.e. whiteish lines in MIDAS.
 *   5. mitk::ContourModelSet = a set of contours for the next slice, i.e. turquoise blue lines in MIDAS.
 *   6. mitk::Image = binary image, same size as item 0, to represent the current region growing, i.e. blue lines in MIDAS.
 * </pre>
 * Useful notes towards helping the understanding of this class
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Items 1-6 are set up in the mitk::DataManager as hidden children of item 0.</li>
 *   <li>The segmentation is very specific to a given view, as for example the ContourModelSet in WorkingData items 2,3,4,5 are only generated for a single slice, corresponding to the currently selected render window.</li>
 *   <li>Region growing is 2D on the currently selected slice, except when doing propagate up or propagate down.</li>
 *   <li>Apologies that this is rather a large monolithic class.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Additionally, significant bits of functionality include:
 *
 * <h2>Recalculation of Seed Position</h2>
 *
 * The number of seeds for a slice often needs re-computing.  This is often because a slice
 * has been automatically propagated, and hence we need new seeds for each slice because
 * as you scroll through slices, regions without a seed would be wiped. For a given slice, the seeds
 * are set so that each disjoint (i.e. not 4-connected) region will have its own seed at the
 * largest minimum distance from the edge, scanning only in a vertical or horizontal direction.
 * In other words, for an image containing a single region:
 * <pre>
 * Find the first voxel in the image, best voxel location = current voxel location,
 * and best distance = maximum number of voxels along an image axis.
 * For each voxel
 *   Scan +x, -x, +y, -y and measure the minimum distance to the boundary
 *   If minimum distance > best distance
 *     best voxel location = current voxel location
 *     best distance = minimum distance
 * </pre>
 * The result is the largest minimum distance, or the largest minimum distance to an edge, noting
 * that we are not scanning diagonally.
 *
 * <h2>Propagate Up/Down/3D</h2>
 *
 * Propagate runs a 3D region propagation from and including the current slice up/down, writing the
 * output to the current segmentation volume, overwriting anything already there.
 * The current slice is always affected. So, you can leave the threshold tick box either on or off.
 * For each subsequent slice in the up/down direction, the number of seeds is recomputed (as above).
 * 3D propagation is exactly equivalent to clicking "prop up" followed by "prop down".
 * Here, note that in 3D, you would normally do region growing in a 6-connected neighbourhood.
 * Here, we are doing a 5D connected neighbourhood, as you always propagate forwards in one
 * direction. i.e. in a coronal slice, and selecting "propagate up", which means propagate anterior,
 * then you cannot do region growing in the posterior direction. So its a 5D region growing.
 *
 * <h2>Threshold Apply</h2>
 *
 * The threshold "apply" button is only enabled when the threshold check-box is enabled,
 * and disabled otherwise. The current segmentation, draw tool contours and poly tool contours
 * (eg. WorkingData items 2 and 3, plus temporary data in the mitk::MIDASPolyTool) all limit the
 * region growing.
 *
 * When we hit "apply":
 * <pre>
 * 1. Takes the current region growing image, and writes it to the current image.
 * 2. Recalculate the number of seeds for that slice, 1 per disjoint region, as above.
 * 3. Turn off thresholding, leaving sliders at current value.
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h2>Wipe, Wipe+, Wipe-</h2>
 *
 * All three pieces of functionality appear similar, wiping the whole slice, whole anterior
 * region, or whole posterior region, including all segmentation and seeds. The threshold controls
 * are not changed. So, if it was on before, it will be on afterwards.
 *
 * <h2>Retain Marks</h2>
 *
 * The "retain marks" functionality only has an impact if we change slices. When the "retain marks"
 * checkbox is ticked, and we change slices we:
 * <pre>
 * 1. Check if the new slice is empty.
 * 2. If not empty we warn.
 * 3. If the user elects to overwrite the new slice, we simply copy all seeds and all image data to the new slice.
 * </pre>
