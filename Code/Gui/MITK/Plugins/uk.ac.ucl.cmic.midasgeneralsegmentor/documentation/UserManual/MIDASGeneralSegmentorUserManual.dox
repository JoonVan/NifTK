\section MIDASIrregIntro Introduction

This plugin provides the MIDAS Irregular Volume Editor, which is a general purpose tool
for segmenting images. At the heart of the method, there is a region growing algorithm,
but the additional of several tools such as the ability to automatically propagate segmentations
forward/backward through slices, and to erase regions quickly over multiple slices make this plugin 
very useful for a wide variety of tasks, and provides additional benefit over and above other similar editors.

The MIDAS Irregular Volume Editor and the MIDAS Morphological Editor were developed at
the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London (UCL)</a>,
<a href="http://dementia.ion.ucl.ac.uk">Dementia Research Centre</a>. The Morphological Editor
provides a protocol specifically for brain segmentation from T1 images. The Irregular Volume Editor
can then be used to post-process brain segmentations after the Morphological Editor, or can
be used in it's own right, to segment any structure.  Typically the Irregular Volume Editor 
is used to segment hippocampi, ventricles, caudate and thalamus, which are of particular
interest in the study of various neuro-degenerative diseases.

\section MIDASIrregImportantNotes Important Notes

\li You will need a 3 button mouse, or 3 button mouse emulation.
\li The MIDAS Irregular Volume Editor is designed to work with the MIDAS Drag and Drop Display.
\li In contrast to the original MIDAS, the segmentation that is saved to the image will by default be outlined in
green. However, in addition to this, on the currently selected slice, the outline is overlaid with orange contours.
When these are manually edited, you will see the underlying current segmentation in green. The orange contours
are not saved into the image, they are there for guidance, until they are "applied" to the current segmentation.

\section MIDASIrregRegionGrowing Region Growing

Region growing is based on 

\li A starting position, called a "seed" is placed in the image and if this voxel satisfies inclusion criteria, it is added to the segmentation.
\li The surrounding voxels, are checked and if they satisfy the same inclusion criteria, they are also added
\li The process is repeated until no more voxels can be added.

So, the interesting points are:

\li In this case the surrounding voxels are in 2D the 4-connected neighbours, meaning the pixel above, below, left and right of the current voxel, so not going diagonally.
\li The inclusion criteria: The output segmentation must be currently blank at the same location, the grey 
value must be greater than or equal to the lower limit, less than or equal to the upper limit, not passing the 
edge of the border of the image, and not passing any limiting contours such as the bounding limit of the brain,
or any other guiding line that the user has placed.

So, for this tool, the current region growing outline changes in real-time as the thresholds are changed.
More seeds can be added, and the region growing simply grows out from all seeds simultaneously. See Figure 1.

\image html RegionGrowingExample.png "Figure 1. A seed is placed (small red cross), and as thresholds are changed, the region is highlighted in blue."

\section MIDASIrregAuxView Auxilliary View

The MIDAS Irregular Volume Editor has a set of controls. Within these controls, is an additional 
secondary view of the image. By default this secondary view shows one image plane. As you click on 
image planes within the main window, this secondary view updates to show a diffent orientation.
See Figure 2.

\image html SecondaryView.png "Figure 2. If the main window is showing region growing in the coronal plane (Figure 1.), the secondary view will show a different plane."

There would be no point simply showing the same slice and orientation. For example, if the main 
window shows coronal, the secondary window will show axial. There is a "2 view" check box, which 
enables this secondary view to show 2 image planes. So if the main window is on coronal, the 
secondary view will respond by showing axial and sagittal. The secondary view responds to mouse interaction
like the main MIDAS Drag and Drop Editor, but generally speaking it is for information purposes only.

\section MIDASIrregSeedTool Seed Tool

To start region growing, seeds must be placed.  There are 3 main tools in the tool box, which are mutually 
exclusive. Activating a given tool will de-activate any current tool. The 3 tools are called the Seed Tool,
Draw Tool and Poly Tool.  Tools are selected by pressing the appropriate button. All 3 tools can add seeds
by right clicking on the current slice.  The Seed tool however has more options:

\li Use the left button to click on a seed and select it, then holding the mouse down, drag the seed to a new location.
\li Use the middle button to click near a seed, and the nearest seed (up to a limiting distance) will be erased. You can "hoover up" seeds 
by holding the middle mouse button down, and moving it over many seeds.

\section MIDASIrregDrawTool Draw Tool

The Draw tool enables the user to place lines into the image. The lines are able to limit the region growing.
Region growing will expand until it hits one of these lines. Many lines may be added. When the user changes slice
or hits "clean", these additional lines become amalgamated into the current segmentation of the current slice, and
so are erased. In contrast with other tools, lines are computed specifically to traverse round the edge of voxels.

\li Use the left button to click and hold down and drag to draw lines. See Figure 3.
\li Use the middle button to click and hold down and erase the orange contours. See Figure 4. 

\image html DrawTool.png "Figure 3. The Draw Tool can be used to limit the region growing."

\image html DrawToolErase.png "Figure 4. Following from Figure 3, the middle mouse button can be used to erase contours, and the region growing again updates accordingly."

\section MIDASIrregPolyTool Poly Tool

The Poly tool is used to create Poly Lines by clicking on specific points that are automatically joined up
using straight lines. As with the draw tool, these lines are used to limit the current region growing, and
are amalgamated into the current segmentation when the slice is saved in any way.

\li Use the left button to click and denote specific points to form the poly line. See Figure 5.
\li The poly line is rendered in yellow.
\li Use the middle mouse button to select and drag the nearest point and move it. As the line is moving
you will see the yellow line for the current position, and a green line to denote whence it came. 

\image html PolyTool.png "Figure 5. The Poly Tool is used to create Poly Lines, i.e. connected points."

\section MIDASIrregThresholdApply Applying The Threshold

Once a region is correctly defined as the result of the region growing and setting appropriate boundaries,
the current slice is applied by clicking "apply".  The blue region growing line turns orange on the
currently selected slice, and the outline is stored in the segmented image. The thresholding controls
are disabled.

\section MIDASIrregSeedPositioning Seed Positioning

When the threshold is "applied", the seed position will be optimised. This is so that when scrolling through slices,
the minimum number of adjustments is necessary. For each disjoint region, there will be 1 seed placed as the largest
minimum distance from the edge, searching in a horizontal and vertical fashion, not diagonally.

\section MIDASIrregNoThresholdingRegions Creating Regions Without Thresholding

Having now seen how region growing works, it is possible to work without region growing. However, a seed is still
required.  If you draw round a region, and put a seed in, then this region will be stored when changing slice to the
next or prior slice. If the slice has un-enclosed seeds, i.e. a seed that is not fully contained within a region,
the slice will be silently wiped.

\section MIDASIrregChangeSlice Changing Slice

By changing slice, we refer to changing to the slice immediately before or after, either by scrolling the mouse wheel
one click, forward ot back, or by using the A (forward), or Z (back) keys, or using the slider in the MIDAS Drag
and Drop Display. Simply changing slice is equivalent to:

\li If thresholding is on: do "apply", 

\li If thresholding is off: If we have un-enclosed seeds, wipe slice silently, and move onto next slice. 
Do region growing without thresholds, to save regions that have been manually drawn. Then process the seeds as in the 
case where thresholding was on.
  
\li Then, if next slice is empty, take seeds on current slice and copy to next slice at corresponding position. 
If next slice is not empty, take the seeds on the next slice, and optimise their position as described above.

\section MIDASIrregPriorNext See Prior Or Next Slices

The user can at any point click "see prior" or "see next" to see an outline of the previous or next slice
projected onto the current slice. See Figure 6.

\image html PriorNext.png "Figure 6. The see prior and see next options project the outline of the prior or next slice onto the current slice."

\section MIDASIrregPropUpDown Region Propagation

The propose of propagate Up/Down or 3D is to use region growing to carry a thresholded region forward/backward
automatically. By Up or Down we mean:

\li If the current slice is coronal: Up=anterior, Down=posterior
\li If the current slice is axial: Up=superior, Down=inferior
\li If the current slice is sagittal: Up=right, Down=left

For propagate up:

\li Propagate Up means: Take the seeds on the current slice, and apply 5D region growing from and including the 
current slice, anterior/superior/right throughout the volume, and immediately "apply" the threshold to each slice.
\li Propagate Down means: As Up, but moving posterior/inferior/left.
\li Propagate 3D means: Do both Up and Down.

In 2D, the region growing is 4-connected. So as you look at the slice, each pixel will grow to its neighbours
immediately up, down, left and right of itself. i.e. 4 neighbours.  In a 3D region growing, we would normally
use the 6 connected neighbours, (up, down, left, right, forward, back).  However, if we are propagating forward
through the volume, then we never use the voxel backwards of the current one. Similarly, if we are propagating
backwards, we never use the voxel forwards of the current one. Hence it should be considered 5D region growing. 
 
\section MIDASIrregWipe Fast Wiping of Slices

Having understood the explanation for propagating up or down, the wipe, wipe- and wipe+ buttons are obvious.

\li wipe: clear the current slice
\li wipe-: clear all slices down from the current, meaning posterior, inferior or left
\li wipe+: clear all slices up from the current, meaning anterior, superior or right

\section MIDASIrregOkResetCancel Ok, Reset, Cancel Buttons

\li OK: Accept, and finish the current segmentation, destroying any internal reference data, and 
ending up with the "finished product". You can always restart it later to continue editing.
\li Reset: Clear, the current segmentation, which means go back to the beginning.
\li Cancel: Destroy the current segmentation and all internal reference data.

A special point of note: If you close the MIDAS Irregular Volume Editor without hitting OK, the result
is equivalent to hitting Cancel, not OK.
