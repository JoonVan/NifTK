 * \class MIDASDrawTool
 * \brief Tool to draw lines around voxel edges like MIDAS does rather than through them
 * as most of the MITK tools do.
 *
 * Provides
 * <pre>
 * 1. Left mouse button down = start line
 * 2. Move with left button down = continue line
 * 3. Left mouse button release = finish line
 * 4. Middle mouse button down = erase anything within the range given by the Eraser (cursor size).
 * 5. Move with middle mouse button down = same as 4.
 * 6. Middle mouse button release = finish editing.
 * </pre>
 * and includes Undo/Redo functionality.
