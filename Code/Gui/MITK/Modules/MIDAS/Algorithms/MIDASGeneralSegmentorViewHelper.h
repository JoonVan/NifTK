/// \brief This file contains functions that convert between ITK and MITK contour representations.
///
/// Contours can be represented in similar way in ITK and MITK, but for the purposes of the
/// MIDAS segmentation tools we restrict the representation according to the following terms.
///
/// ITK filters expect a contour in which there is a point on the side of every pixel, but
/// not necessarily in the corners.
///
/// E.g. a contour around three adjacent pixels can be stored like this:
///
/// (1)
///
///     +---o---+---o---+---o---+
///     |       |       |       |
///     o       |       |       o
///     |       |       |       |
///     +---o---+---o---+---o---+
///
/// Note that there are no 'corner points' in the contour.
/// If we simply copied these points to an MITK contour, it would be rendered like this:
///
///         -----------------
///       /                   \
///      <                     >
///       \                   /
///         -----------------
///
/// That is, the adjacent contour points would be connected by a straight line, cutting off the corners.
/// To get around this, we use a modified version of the contour extraction filter that keeps the corners,
/// i.e. creates a contour of a segmentation like this:
///
/// (2)
///
///     o---o---+---o---+---o---o
///     |       |       |       |
///     o       |       |       o
///     |       |       |       |
///     o---o---+---o---+---o---o
///
/// Note that the corner points are stored only when the contour "turns", not at at every pixel corner.
/// The intermediate points are still at the side of the pixels.
///
/// If we copy this to an MITK contour set as it is, it is rendered as a rectangle:
///
///     +-----------------------+
///     |                       |
///     |                       |
///     |                       |
///     +-----------------------+
///
/// However, the following MITK contour would render to the same rectangle:
///
/// (3)
///
///     o-------+-------+-------o
///     |       |       |       |
///     |       |       |       |
///     |       |       |       |
///     o-------+-------+-------o
///
/// Reducing the number of contour points can significantly speed up the rendering. Moreover,
/// the MITK contours are often cloned because of the undo-redo operations, so it is good to
/// minimise the number of contour points for memory efficiency as well.
///
/// Currently, the draw tool creates a contour that stores every contour point, like this:
///
/// (4)
///
///     o-------o-------o-------o
///     |       |       |       |
///     |       |       |       |
///     |       |       |       |
///     o-------o-------o-------o
///
/// There should be only two kinds of representations.
///
/// ITK contours should be in the form (2), i.e.:
///
///     a) The start point of any contour must be a corner point.
///     b) The end point of any contour must be a corner point.
///     c) The contour must contain a point at the middle of the side of every pixel along the contour path, and
///     d) one at each pixel corner where the direction of the contour path changes.
///     e) The contour must not contain any other corner point along the path.
///
/// MITK contours should be in the form (3), i.e.:
///
///     f) The start point of any contour must be a corner point.
///     g) The end point of any contour must be a corner point.
///     h) The contour must not contain any point on the side of a pixel.
///     i) The contour must contain a point at each pixel corner where the direction of the contour path changes.
///     j) The contour must not contain any other corner point along the path.
///
/// Moreover,
///
///     k) Any contour must contain at least two (different) points.
