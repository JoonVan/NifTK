\section SnapshotIntroduction Introduction

The Snapshot plugin simply provides a quick way to take a screenshot of your current main window. The implementation is basic.
Any windows covering the viewer will be included in the snapshot. So, make sure you have no windows overlapping the main viewer.

\section SnapshotUsage Usage

The Snapshot plugin is launched by clicking on "Window" on the top menu bar, then "Show View", then "Snapshot".
The controls are a single button (Figure 1).

When the user clicks this button, the application takes a copy of the main window, and gives the option of saving it 
to file with the standard system File Save As dialog box. Valid file extensions are .png.

Future work will enable this screen to take snapshots when the viewer is obscured, or has windows overlapping it.
