\section NiftyMITKPurpose Purpose

The NiftyMITK application was developed by the 
<a href="http://cmic.cs.ucl.ac.uk">Centre For Medical Image Computing (CMIC)</a> as a general
purpose research application for medical image visualisation and analysis, and to support
image guided interventions. It is not intended for clinical use.

By design, all available plugins for the NifTK platform will be available in NiftyMITK.
More specific application will also be developed, and provide a subset of the functionality 
according to different user requirements.  For example, CMIC has also developed
 
\li NiftyMIDAS, which is a specific program for the 
<a href="http://dementia.ion.ucl.ac.uk/">UCL Dementia Research Centre</a>, to provide
image analysis tools to study dementia.
\li NiftyIGI to provide a platform for research into Image Guided Interventions (IGI).
