From the main Menu Bar, selecting "Window", then "View" shows the list of Views. 
A View provides a discrete piece of functionality such as changing intensity window settings, 
segmentation tools, iso-surface generation and so on. Selecting each View will launch a small window
containing the View if indeed the View is not already shown. The View provides the necessary 
controls for that discrete piece of functionality. Each View should be designed to be as stand-alone 
as possible. In addition to the controls on the View's window, there may also be an optional 
preference page. By way of example, Figure 1. shows the controls for 
<a href="qthelp://uk.ac.ucl.cmic.imagelookuptables/bundle/index.html">The Image Lookup Tables View</a>
enabling the user to choose a lookup table and settings such as window, level, minimum intensity and 
maximum intensity.

Furthermore, each View has its own Help page. Selecting the View and hitting F1 will launch 
context sensitive help.
