The Nifty applications could potentially start up with an almost empty screen. Figure 1. shows 
the screen and the top menu bar as displayed under Mac OSX. The exact appearance will depend 
on your platform. The main screen area shows nothing more than a grey outline, and by default the 
<a href="http://www.mitk.org">MITK</a> <a href="qthelp://org.mitk.gui.qt.datamanager/bundle/index.html">Data Manager</a> 
View is visible, and uncloseable. 

The Main Window provides:

\li File Open/Save.
\li Project Open/Save.
\li Access to user preferences.
\li Useful information about the application provided via the "About" dialog box.
\li A view of the Data Storage provided with the Data Manager plugin - in Figure 1. it is empty.

The "About" dialog box provides acknowledgements, links to third party software licenses, and 
important versioning information.

The "User Preferences" dialog provides a single place to find all the user preferences. 
Each plugin can contain various preferences and configuration parameters that 
will appear in this dialog box.
