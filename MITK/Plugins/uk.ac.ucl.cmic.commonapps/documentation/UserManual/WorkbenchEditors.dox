Imagine you are using a popular word processing program.  The source of data is the 
document you are writing. The application provides a a main view of the document, and 
lets you edit the data. This main view is the Editor. There can be more than one Editor, 
for example to show two different documents, or show two different pages of the
same document, but their purpose is the same: Editors show the "main view" of the data.

The Nifty applications have the same principal at heart. The application will load an 
assortment of data. The screen will contain one or more Editors to provide a view of the data. 
Figure 1. shows the Drag and Drop Display Editor developed for the MIDAS project.

As the Nifty platform expands, expect to find new Editors to handle different types
of data, and to provide different ways of interacting with the data.
