/**
 * \class MultiWindowWidget
 * \brief Subclass of QmitkStdMultiWidget to provide MIDAS specific functionality
 * by having convenient methods to control geometry, background, cursors on/off etc.
 * via calling methods in the base class QmitkStdMultiWidget.
 *
 * In MIDAS terms, the widget will nearly always be in Axial, Coronal or Sagittal mode, but we
 * subclass QmitkStdMultiWidget so that we can optionally have 3D views, ortho-views etc.
 *
 * Please do NOT expose this class to the rest of the NiftyView code-base, or else
 * dependency management becomes a bit of an issue.  The class SingleViewerWidget
 * wraps this one, and the rest of our application should only deal with
 * SingleViewerWidget.
 *
 * Note: The requirements specification for MIDAS style zoom basically says:
 * <pre>
 * magnification   : actual pixels per voxel.
 * on MIDAS widget :
 * 2               : 3
 * 1               : 2
 * 0               : 1 (i.e. no magnification).
 * -1              : 0.5 (i.e. 1 pixel covers 2 voxels).
 * -2              : 0.33 (i.e. 1 pixel covers 3 voxels).
 * etc.
 * </pre>
 *
 * In contrast with the original MIDAS, in NiftyMIDAS the zooming is continuous, so
 * the rule above is extended to real numbers as well. If the image has anisotropic pixels then
 * the size of the longer side of the voxels is used for the calculation for each orientation.
