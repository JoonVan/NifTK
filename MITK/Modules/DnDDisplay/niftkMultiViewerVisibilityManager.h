/**
 * \class MultiViewerVisibilityManager
 * \brief Maintains a list of niftkSingleViewerWidgets and coordinates visibility
 * properties by listening to AddNodeEvent, RemoveNodeEvent and listening directly
 * to Modified events from the nodes "visible" property in DataStorage.
 *
 * The strategy is the following:
 *
 * If a new data node is added to the data storage, a renderer specific visibility
 * property is created for the render windows of each registered viewer. The initial
 * visibility is false.
 * At the same time, an observer is registered to listen to the change of the global
 * visibility of the node.
 * When the global visibility of a node changes, its visibility specific to the renderer
 * of th selected window is turned to the same as the global visibility.
 * Similarly in the other around, when the selected window changes, the global visibility
 * of the data nodes is set to the same as the visibility specific to the selected
 * window.
 *
 * Note:
 * Since this class will change the global visibility, it cannot be used together with
 * the MITK display that does not maintain renderer specific visibilities to its render
 * windows.
