Unexpected cursor position after changing window layout:

Steps to reproduce:
1. Open an image and drag it onto the DnD display.
2. Press 'w' to switch to sagittal.
3. Press 'q' to switch to axial.
4. Press 'e' to switch back to coronal.
5. Press 'q'. So far so good.
6. Press 'w'.

At this point the image should be in the centre, just like after step 2.
But it is not. If you resize the window, the image is moved to the
expected, central position.
