/**
 * \class QmitkThumbnailRenderWindow
 * \brief Subclass of QmitkRenderWindow to track to another QmitkRenderWindow
 * and provide a zoomed-out view with an overlay of a bounding box to provide the
 * current size of the currently tracked QmitkRenderWindow's view-port size.
 * \ingroup uk.ac.ucl.cmic.thumbnail
 *
 * The client must
 * <pre>
 * 1. Create widget
 * 2. Call "Activated" to register with the data storage when the widget is considered active (eg. on screen).
 * 3. Call "Deactivated" to de-register with the data storage when the widget is considered not-active (eg. off screen).
 * </pre>
 *
 * The data storage will be initialised from the rendering manager at the first activation.
 *
 * This class provides methods to set the bounding box opacity, line thickness,
 * and rendering layer. These values would normally be set via preferences pages in the GUI.
 * The preferences part is done in the ThumbnailView, but this widget could potentially be placed
 * in any layout, as a small preview window of sorts.
 *
 * This widget also has methods to decide whether we respond to mouse or wheel events.
 * By default the design was to not allow wheel events, as this would cause the slice to change,
 * which should then be propagated back to all other windows, and we don't know which windows
 * are listening, or need updating. However, with regards to left mouse, click and move events,
 * where the user is selecting the focus, then this is automatically passed to the global
 * mitk::FocusManager which propagates to all registered views. So mouse events default to on.
