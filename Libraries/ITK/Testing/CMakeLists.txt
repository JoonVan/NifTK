# From gcc 4.6 on, shared libaries are linked with the '--as-needed' option by default.
# This means that if a binary does not use an exported symbol from a library then that
# library will not be linked to the binary. This will cause that the static variables
# of the library will not be initialise.
# However, we use a static variable in niftkITK to register the IO factories. As a
# simple but a bit dirty workaround, here we forcibly link every library to the test
# drivers that was added to their dependencies in CMake.
