\section MainPageIntroduction Introduction

The @NIFTK_PLATFORM@ platform was developed as one part of a strategic initiative within
<a href="@NIFTK_ORIGIN_URL@">@NIFTK_ORIGIN_SHORT_TEXT@</a> to enhance the translation 
of medical imaging algorithms from the computer science lab to every-day clinical use.

@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ was developed with funding from the <a href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/">NIHR</a> and the <a href="http://www.uclhospitals.brc.nihr.ac.uk/">Comprehensive Biomedical 
Research Centre</a> at <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk">UCL</a> and <a href="http://www.uclh.nhs.uk">UCLH</a> grant 168 and TSB grant M1638A. The principal investigator 
is <a href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/sebastien.ourselin.html">Sebastien Ourselin</a>
now Head of <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/lsm/research/divisions/imaging/about/People.aspx">The School
of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/index.aspx">King's College London</a>.
The team leader is <a href="https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=MJCLA42">Matt Clarkson</a>,
in the <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing">Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC)</a> at <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London</a>.

The term @NIFTK_PLATFORM@ refers to the whole collection of Nifty<Something> packages 
developed by <a href="@NIFTK_ORIGIN_URL@">@NIFTK_ORIGIN_SHORT_TEXT@</a> and listed 
<a href="http://cmictig.cs.ucl.ac.uk/research/software/software-nifty">here</a>.

In addition, there is a specific code repository called @NIFTK_PLATFORM@, which can be considered
as a parent project, containing several graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as NiftyView, NiftyMIDAS and
NiftyIGI, many command line programs and assorted scripts. Furthermore, this parent project, called @NIFTK_PLATFORM@,
can download and build some of the smaller Nifty<Something> packages, thereby providing an integrated suite
of applications. So this specific page and linked pages of documentation refer specifically to the @NIFTK_PLATFORM@
code repository.
