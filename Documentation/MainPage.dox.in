\section MainPageIntroduction Introduction

@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ is co-developed by members of the
<a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/medical-image-computing">Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC)</a> at <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/">University College London (UCL)</a>
and <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/lsm/research/divisions/imaging/about/People.aspx">The School
of Biomedical Engineering and Imaging Sciences</a> at <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/index.aspx">King's College London (KCL)</a>.
The Principal Investigator is <a href="https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/sebastien.ourselin.html">Prof. Sebastien Ourselin</a> at KCL
and the Team Leader is <a href="https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=MJCLA42">Dr Matt Clarkson</a> at UCL.

The term @NIFTK_PLATFORM@ refers to the whole collection of Nifty<Something> packages 
developed by <a href="@NIFTK_ORIGIN_URL@">@NIFTK_ORIGIN_SHORT_TEXT@</a> and listed 
<a href="http://www.niftk.org">here</a>.

In addition, there is a specific code repository called @NIFTK_PLATFORM@, which can be considered
as a parent project, containing several graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as NiftyView, NiftyMIDAS and
NiftyIGI, many command line programs and assorted scripts. Furthermore, this parent project, called @NIFTK_PLATFORM@,
can download and build some of the smaller Nifty<Something> packages, thereby providing an integrated suite
of applications. So this specific page and linked pages of documentation refer specifically to the @NIFTK_PLATFORM@
code repository.
