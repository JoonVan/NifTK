\section TechnicalManualIntro Introduction

Welcome to the @NIFTK_PLATFORM@ technical manual. This manual provides the detailed technical information
for the platform and any further information can be obtained be joining:

\li <a href="@NIFTK_USER_CONTACT@">the users' mailing list</a>

The aim of providing this manual is to enable developers to understand the architecture, the code design, 
layout and conventions, and to start coding and contributing to the platform. Where necessary or informative 
the design decisions will be explained in detail. It is however assumed that the reader is a good C++ developer.

\section TechnicalManualAdditional Additional Reading

<h3>The MITK Infrastructure</h3>

<a href="http://www.mitk.org">MITK</a> forms the underlying infrastructure for the GUI applications. So, developers
should be reading and digesting, on a regular basis, the main MITK <a href="http://www.mitk.org">website</a>,
the <a href="http://docs.mitk.org/nightly-qt4/">API</a> and also the
<a href="http://www.mitk.org/BugSquashingSeminars">Bug Squashing Seminars</a>.

<h3>The MITK Segmentation Framework</h3>

At least three of the available plugins are segmentation tools. The underlying architecture of these plugins
is derived in some ways from the MITK Segmentation Framework described
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260709001229">here</a>.

<h3>The Medical Image Display And Analysis System (MIDAS) Application</h3>

Throughout this manual we may refer to an application called MIDAS. MIDAS was developed by
Pete Freeborough and Nick Fox at the UCL Dementia Research Centre. Many of the important
features of MIDAS have been re-implemented and brought to this multi-platform environment
with a lot of new functionality. The interested reader should refer to:

[1] Peter A. Freeborough, Nick C. Fox and Richard I. Kitney: Interactive Algorithms for the 
segmentation and quantitation off 3-D MRI brain scans. Computer Methods and Programs In Biomedicine,
(53), 15-25, 1997. 
<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260797018038">doi:10.1016/S0169-2607(97)01803-8</a>.

<h3>The Slicer Execution Model</h3>

The Graphical User Interface (GUI)'s contained within this project can run command line executables as a 
background process, using the Command Line Modules view. The underlying technology was developed as part
of the <a href="http://www.slicer.org">Slicer</a> project, ported to the 
<a href="http://www.gimias.org">GIMIAS</a> project, and then re-implemented within the 
<a href="http://www.commontk.org">Common Toolkit (CTK)</a> project. Technical details can be found
<a href="http://www.slicer.org/slicerWiki/index.php/Slicer3:Execution_Model_Documentation">here</a>.
This technology is particularly interesting for developers interested in inter-operability.
If you develop a command line module using this method, it should be runnable in NifTK applications
and MITK, GIMIAS and Slicer.
