\page BuildInstructions The Build Instructions

NifTK can be built easily using CMake. The whole process will download and install all the third party libraries
necessary, and works identically in Windows, Linux and Mac. However, there are some caveats due to different
machine configurations in different departments. Thus, it is better to include these instructions on a wiki
so the information can be immediately updated.

So, the build instructions are currently <a href="@NIFTK_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS@">here</a>.
