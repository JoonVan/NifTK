\section InstallationInstructionsIntroduction Introduction

This @NIFTK_PLATFORM@ package installs a suite of software, and extra steps are needed to setup your system 
after the installer runs. These steps are important. Without these steps you will have 
either fewer programs available, or programs that do not run correctly.
Please see the instructions below.

\section InstallationInstructionsMac Mac OSX

<ol>
<li> Drag and drop the @NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@ folder onto the Applications folder. 
<li> The software will install into /Applications/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@
<li> In your shell startup script ~/.bash_profile put
\verbatim
export NIFTK_DIR=/Applications/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@
source ${NIFTK_DIR}/bin/SetupNifTK.sh
\endverbatim
</ol>

\section InstallationInstructionsLinux Linux

<ol>
<li> Download the .tar.gz file, into the directory you want to install into. For these instructions 
    we will call this <INSTALL_DIR>, which should be substituted below for your installation dir. 
<li> Extract the tar file using:
\verbatim
tar -zxvf @NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@.tar.gz 
\endverbatim
<li> If you are running a bash shell put:
\verbatim
export NIFTK_DIR=<INSTALL_DIR>/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@
source ${NIFTK_DIR}/bin/SetupNifTK.sh
\endverbatim
in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile 
<li> Or if you are running a csh put:
\verbatim
setenv NIFTK_DIR <INSTALL_DIR>/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@
source ${NIFTK_DIR}/bin/SetupNifTK.csh
\endverbatim
in your ~/.cshrc
</ol>

Note: Depending on your Linux system administrator, your
shell startup scripts could be different ones, managed by your
system administrator. If in doubt ask your local admin.
For example at UCL Computer Science most managed machines use
a csh and the file to edit is ~/.uclcs-csh-options.

\section InstallationInstructionsWindows Windows

<ol>
<li> Download the .exe file
<li> Run the .exe file following the on-screen prompts.
<li> The software will install into "C:\Program Files\@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ @NIFTK_VERSION_STRING@"
<li> A short-cut will enable you to run NiftyView.
<li> Command line programs will be in "C:\Program Files\@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ @NIFTK_VERSION_STRING@\bin"
<li> Scripts will not be available.
</ol>

\section Running the NiftyView application

Once correctly installed, NiftyView can be run as follows:
<ol>
<li> On a Mac, you can find the NiftyView icon in the /Applications/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@ and drag it to the dock, or create an alias on your Desktop and run that. On the command line, the program is available as NiftyView.
<li> On Linux, you should run NiftyView.sh
<li> On Windows, you can launch NiftyView from the Start menu then @NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@ then NiftyView, or from the Desktop icon if you selected that option, and also from the command line if you chose to add it to the system or user PATH. 
</ol>
