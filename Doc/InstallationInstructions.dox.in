\section InstallationInstructionsIntroduction Introduction

This @NIFTK_PLATFORM@ package installs a suite of software, and extra steps are needed to setup your system 
after the installer runs. These steps are important. Without these steps you will have 
either fewer programs available, or programs that do not run correctly.
Please see the instructions below.

\section InstallationInstructionsMac Mac OSX

<ol>
<li> Drag and drop the @NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@ folder onto the Applications folder. 
<li> The software will install into /Applications/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@
<li> In your shell startup script ~/.bash_profile put
\verbatim
export NIFTK_DIR=/Applications/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@
source ${NIFTK_DIR}/bin/SetupNifTK.sh
\endverbatim
</ol>

\section InstallationInstructionsLinux Linux

<ol>
<li> Download the .tar.gz file, into the directory you want to install into. For these instructions 
    we will call this <INSTALL_DIR>, which should be substituted below for your installation dir. 
<li> Extract the tar file using:
\verbatim
tar -zxvf @NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@.tar.gz 
\endverbatim
<li> If you are running a bash shell put:
\verbatim
export NIFTK_DIR=<INSTALL_DIR>/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@
source ${NIFTK_DIR}/bin/SetupNifTK.sh
\endverbatim
in your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile 
<li> Or if you are running a csh put:
\verbatim
setenv NIFTK_DIR <INSTALL_DIR>/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@
source ${NIFTK_DIR}/bin/SetupNifTK.csh
\endverbatim
in your ~/.cshrc
</ol>

Note: Depending on your Linux system administrator, your
shell startup scripts could be different ones, managed by your
system administrator. If in doubt ask your local admin.
For example at UCL Computer Science most managed machines use
a csh and the file to edit is ~/.uclcs-csh-options.

\section InstallationInstructionsWindows Windows

<ol>
<li> Download the .exe file
<li> Run the .exe file following the on-screen prompts.
<li> The software will install into "C:\Program Files\@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ @NIFTK_VERSION_STRING@"
<li> A short-cut will enable you to run NiftyView.
<li> Command line programs will be in "C:\Program Files\@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ @NIFTK_VERSION_STRING@\bin"
<li> Scripts will not be available.
<li> Note: When the installer finishes there is a checkbox to launch NiftyView. This currently does not work, and NiftyView should be run from the Start menu.
</ol>
