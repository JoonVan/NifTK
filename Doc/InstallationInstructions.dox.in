IMPORTANT: Installation
-----------------------------

This package installs a suite of software, and 
extra steps are needed to setup your system 
after the installer runs. These are important, 
and the software won't run properly without these 
steps. Please see the instructions below.

Installation: Mac OSX
----------------------------------

1. The package will install into 

   /Applications/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@
   
2. In your shell startup script 
   (normally bash shell, so in ~/.bash_profile), put:

   export NIFTK_DIR=/Applications/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@
   source ${NIFTK_DIR}/bin/SetupNifTK.sh
   
   or if you are running a csh
   (so in ~/.cshrc), put:

   setenv NIFTK_DIR /Applications/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@
   source ${NIFTK_DIR}/bin/SetupNifTK.csh
   
Installation: Linux - Non Ubuntu
--------------------------------

1. Download the .tar.gz file, into the directory 
   you want to install into. For these instructions
   we will call this <INSTALL_DIR>, which should
   be substituted below for your installation dir. 
   
   Extract the tar file using:
   
   tar -zxvf @NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@.tar.gz 
   
2. In your shell startup script 
   (normally bash shell, so in ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bashrc), put:

   export NIFTK_DIR=<INSTALL_DIR>/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@
   source ${NIFTK_DIR}/bin/SetupNifTK.sh
   
   or if you are running a csh
   (so in ~/.cshrc), put:

   setenv NIFTK_DIR <INSTALL_DIR>/@NIFTK_DEPLOY_NAME@
   source ${NIFTK_DIR}/bin/SetupNifTK.csh

Note: Depending on your Linux system administrator, your
shell startup scripts could be different ones, managed by your
system administrator. If in doubt ask your local admin.
