\section UserManualCommandLineAppsCaveats Known Caveats

\li Please read \link UnderstandingFileIO some background on file I/O in NifTK.
\li Most file read/write is based on file extensions, with each file reader/writer being implemented by different
classes and hence different authors in ITK/MITK/NifTK.  Command line programs make no guarantees about how well these 
readers/writers work. Please refer to original documentation for each reader/writer.
\li Many ITK filters work on a "voxel by voxel" basis, such as adding, subtracting and multiplying images. 
By this we mean that image geometry such as origin, spacing, orientation etc. are not checked.
