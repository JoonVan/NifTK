\section MainPageIntroduction Introduction

The @NIFTK_PLATFORM@ platform was developed as one part of a strategic initiative within
<a href="@NIFTK_ORIGIN_URL@">@NIFTK_ORIGIN_SHORT_TEXT@</a> to enhance the translation 
of medical imaging algorithms from the computer science lab to every-day clinical use.

@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ was developed with funding from the NIHR and the Comprehensive Biomedical 
Research Centre at UCL and UCLH grant 168 and TSB grant M1638A. The principal investigator 
is <a href="http://cmic.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/sebastien_ourselin/">Sebastien Ourselin</a>
and team leader is <a href="http://cmic.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/matt_clarkson/">Matt Clarkson</a>.

The term @NIFTK_PLATFORM@ refers to the whole collection of Nifty<Something> packages 
developed by <a href="@NIFTK_ORIGIN_URL@">@NIFTK_ORIGIN_SHORT_TEXT@</a> and listed 
<a href="http://cmic.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/software/">here</a>.

In addition, there is a specific code repository called @NIFTK_PLATFORM@, which can be considered
as a parent project, containing several graphical user interfaces (GUIs) such as NiftyView, NiftyMIDAS and
NiftyIGI, many command line programs and assorted scripts. Furthermore, this parent project, called @NIFTK_PLATFORM@,
can download and build all of the smaller Nifty<Something> packages, thereby providing an integrated suite
of applications. So this specific page and linked pages of documentation refer specifically to the @NIFTK_PLATFORM@
code repository.
