\section TechnicalManualIntro Introduction

Welcome to the @NIFTK_PLATFORM@ technical manual. This manual provides the detailed technical information
for the platform and any further information can be obtained be joining:

\li <a href="@NIFTK_DEVELOPER_CONTACT@">the developers mailing list</a>

The aim of providing this manual is to enable developers to understand the architecture, the code design, 
layout and conventions, and to start coding and contributing to the platform. Where necessary or informative 
the design decisions will be explained in detail. It is however assumed that the reader is a C++ developer.

Throughout the manual we refer to an application called MIDAS. MIDAS is an application developed by
Pete Freeborough and Nick Fox at the UCL Dementia Research Centre (DRC). MIDAS is used as a core part of
the imaging trials infrastructure, and has influenced much of the design of NiftyView. NiftyView can
be seen as a re-implementation of many of the important concepts from MIDAS, making the application
multi-platform and bringing a lot of new functionality. The interested reader should refer to:
