\page Dependencies The @NIFTK_PLATFORM@ Dependencies

\section DependenciesIntro Introduction

With the exception of NiftyView, each of the individual Nifty<Something> packages, 
listed <a href="http://cmic.cs.ucl.ac.uk/home/software/">here</a> can be downloaded individually, 
and by design have very few dependencies and are easy to build. This design choice was to
satisfy the needs of the research community, where our users are typically interested in small
lightweight packages that do a very specific job very well.

So, this project contains 
<ul>
<li>\ref UserManualNiftyView - for all platforms.</li>
<li>\ref UserManualCommandLineApps - for all platforms.</li> 
<li>\ref UserManualScripts - for Unix/Linux/Mac users only.</li>
</ul>
as well as the means to download and install all the light-weight Nifty<Something> packages.

This means it is non-trivial to understand all the software dependencies. On this page, the software
dependencies are explained in detail.
 
\section DependenciesVersions Versions

This documentation page, is directly generated from the source code of the project, and the 
current software versions are:
<ul>
<li>Boost: @BOOST_VERSION@ </li>
<li>GDCM: @GDCM_VERSION@ </li>
<li>Qt: @QT_VERSION_MAJOR@.@QT_VERSION_MINOR@.@QT_VERSION_PATCH@ </li>
<li>ITK: @NIFTK_ITK_VERSION_IN_SUPERBUILD@ </li>
<li>VTK: @VTK_VERSION@ </li>
<li>CTK: @CTK_REVISION_ID@ </li>
<li>MITK: @MITK_REVISION_ID@ </li>
<li>@NIFTK_PLATFORM@: @NIFTK_SVN_REVISION_ID@ </li>
</ul>

The software may or may not work with other versions.

\section DependenciesOutline Dependencies

Before building the toolkit, the user must decide whether or not they are building the GUI.
If the user has no intention of building the GUI, and only wants scripts and command line 
programs, then the list of dependencies is different. Thus there are two different sets
of dependencies listed below, where -> denotes "depends upon".

For NON-GUI builds:
<ol>
<li>ITK -> GDCM </li>
<li>MITK -> ITK </li>
<li>MITK -> VTK </li>
<li>MITK -> Boost </li>
<li>@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ -> ITK </li>
<li>@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ -> VTK </li>
<li>@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ -> Boost </li>
<li>@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ -> MITK </li>
</ol>

For GUI builds:
<ol>
<li>VTK -> Qt</li>
<li>ITK -> GDCM </li>
<li>CTK -> Qt </li>
<li>MITK -> ITK </li>
<li>MITK -> VTK </li>
<li>MITK -> Boost </li>
<li>MITK -> CTK </li>
<li>@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ -> ITK </li>
<li>@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ -> VTK </li>
<li>@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ -> Boost </li>
<li>@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ -> CTK </li>
<li>@NIFTK_PLATFORM@ -> MITK </li>
</ol>

Note: So from these lists we can see that Qt, Boost and GDCM have no dependencies, they are built without the
knowledge of any of the other packages. Also note that the larger packages such as CTK can download and install
additional packages, not listed here. For example CTK will download DCMTK, but as the rest of @NIFTK_PLATFORM@
is not specifically using CMake to do a FindDCMTK we do not list it here.
