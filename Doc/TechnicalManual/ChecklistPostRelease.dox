\page TechnicalCheckListPostRelease Checklist: Post-Release

The post-release check list is to make sure that we have installed or delivered NifTK correctly.
There is an implicit assumption that the code was ready to release in the first place.

\li Code tagged with a git tag with format v<Major>.<Minor>, and if patched then v<Major>.<Minor>.<Patch>, for example v12.09 or v12.09.1
\li Tagged version merged to NifTK master branch
\li On comic1, check that NiftyView can be run via 'ssh -X' with the display sent back to a different linux workstation
\li In SetupDependencies.sh, SetupDependencies.csh, SetupNifTK.sh and SetupNifTK.csh, check the NIFTK_DIR
\li Check doxygen crontab on logno updated to the new release number, and cron runs successfully, and web pages are accessible
\li Email sent to niftk-users@ucl.ac.uk, nifty-group@ucl.ac.uk, cmic-all@ucl.ac.uk
